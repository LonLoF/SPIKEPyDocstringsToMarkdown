# SPIKEPyDocstringsToMarkdown
A browser-based tool that extracts and formats Python docstrings into Markdown from .py and .llsp3 (LEGO SPIKE) files.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project was to create a tool for generating documentation for LEGO SPIKE Python code, but it should also work with general Python files. 

## Best Practices

- The best visual output is achieved with **Google-style docstrings**.
- If it seems that some parts of the code are missing from the documentation, ensure that a **docstring is present**.

## Reporting Issues

If the issue persists, **open an issue** with an example of your code that the web tool failed to detect.
